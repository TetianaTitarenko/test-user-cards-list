This project is a simple application that allows you to view and filter a list
of users and their tweets.

To obtain data about users and their tweets, we developed our own backend using
the toolkit provided by the website https://www.mockapi.io. This resource
provides the ability to create APIs for working with them. Thus, we were able to
create our own backend, which provides the necessary functionality for our
project. In addition, we used a ready-made design template from Figma
(https://www.figma.com/file/zun1oP6NmS2Lmgbcj6e1IG/Test?node-id=0-1&t=qy3AxOrUU6ba5qQt-0)
and other libraries to create our project.

To write the application, we used technologies such as HTML, CSS, JS, Parcel,
and libraries like React, React Router, Axios, and Styled Components.
Additionally, we used Lazy Loading to improve performance and reduce the
application load time.

The developer of this project is Tetiana Tytarenko. If you have any questions or
suggestions, please contact us at t.titarenko.f@gmail.com.

To use the web application, you need to open the link in any modern browser.

The application consists of a list of user cards from the Twitter social
network. Each card contains the user's avatar, name, number of tweets and
followers, as well as a button to subscribe/unsubscribe to the user.

To subscribe to a user, you need to click the "Follow" button. This will
increase the number of followers by 1. To unsubscribe, you need to click the
same "Follow" button, after which the number of followers will decrease by 1.

There is also a "Load more" button on the page, which, when clicked, adds 5 more
cards to the list of users.
